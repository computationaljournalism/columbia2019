    "Python is a popular multi-purpose coding language. We usually teach it over the course of weeks but you'll see some of the essentials in the next hour or so (assuming all has gone well in the first half of all this). You're looking at one interface to Python, a Jupyter Notebook. It has two kinds of \"cells\" -- a text or Markdown cell (like this one) and then a Code cell for Python instructions (like the next one). You execute either by holding the shift key and hitting \"enter\"."
